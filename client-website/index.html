      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Alisha Zhao is a freshman at SCAD studying animation. Zhao is familiar
        with many mediums in the animation space, including 2D hand-drawn
        animation, stop-motion, digital character rigging, and motion graphics
        design. She has explored both traditional frame-by-frame techniques and
        modern software workflows, giving her a versatile foundation for
        storytelling through movement. Zhao is also a talented artist, familiar
        with figure drawing, color theory, storyboarding, and concept art
        development. Her sketchbooks reveal a particular interest in character
        design and environmental storytelling, often blending whimsical elements
        with grounded emotional narratives. Outside the studio, she draws
        inspiration from indie animated shorts, graphic novels, and the natural
        landscapes found in Georgia.
