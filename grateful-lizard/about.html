        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p class="body-text">
          Grateful Lizard is a quirky, eco-conscious business that has carved
          out a unique niche in the world of outdoor fashion. Founded with a
          love for both sustainability and individuality, the company draws
          inspiration from nature’s adaptability—embodied by its namesake, the
          resilient lizard. Grateful Lizard designs and manufactures
          high-quality rain hats that blend function with bold, expressive
          style. With eye-catching colors, playful patterns, and
          weather-resistant materials, their products are crafted for
          adventurers, commuters, and free spirits who don’t let a little rain
          dampen their plans.

        <p class="body-text">
          The company’s signature rain hats are more than just protection from
          the elements—they’re wearable statements. Each hat is made using
          recycled and biodegradable materials, aligning with Grateful Lizard’s
          commitment to environmental responsibility. Their flagship designs
          feature wide brims for maximum coverage, breathable linings for
          comfort, and adjustable fits to suit all ages. Whether it’s a monsoon
          in the city or a misty hike through the woods, Grateful Lizard rain
          hats are built to keep wearers dry while turning heads. With a loyal
          following and a growing presence at festivals, markets, and online,
          Grateful Lizard is redefining what it means to dress for the weather.
