        <h2>Our Business</h2>
        <p class="body-text">
          At Grateful Lizard, we believe that rainy days should never mean dull
          days. That’s why every rain hat we create is designed to add a splash
          of personality to your wet-weather wardrobe. Whether you're navigating
          a stormy sidewalk or dancing in festival drizzle, our hats are built
          to move with you—durable enough for real adventures, stylish enough to
          wear anywhere. Each collection is released in limited runs, so when
          you wear a Grateful Lizard hat, you’re not just staying dry—you’re
          standing out.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          We're proud to be a small business with a big mission: to make gear
          that’s as kind to the planet as it is to your sense of style. All of
          our rain hats are ethically made in small batches, using sustainable
          practices and materials that leave a lighter footprint. From our
          biodegradable packaging to our local artist collaborations, every
          detail is thoughtfully considered. Explore our collection and find a
          hat that speaks to you—because staying dry should never mean blending
          in.
