        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Griffin Leventhal, and I am a 21 year old student at UNC
          Charlotte. Coming from the Raleigh area and travelling to Charlotte
          allowed me to experience both cities, and introduced me to two
          seperate yet similar fighting game communities. I was able to
          experience the welcoming nature of these communities, and found myself
          in the midst of a community and group of people that couldn't wait to
          share their hobby and scene with everyone they knew. As such, I feel
          like it's my duty to further this goal and introduce more people! I
          myself got introduced via Tekken and Guilty Gear, where I quickly
          progressed to become a very mediocre player within the scene. I play
          Faust in Guilty Gear and Bryan in Tekken.
        </p>
        <h3>Who is the NC FGC?</h3>
        <p>
          The NC FGC itself is a welcome community that celebrates all kinds of
          fighting games. This vibrant scene is broadly categorized into
          distinct sub-genres such as anime, traditional, arena, and platform
          fighters, each boasting its own developed culture and dedicated player
          base within the larger NC FGC. Despite these unique identities, an
          overarching culture of friendly competition unites everyone, fostering
          an environment where players can grow and connect. Furthermore, the NC
          FGC maintains strong connections to the broader North American
          Fighting Game Community, frequently organizing group trips to major
          events, which not only strengthens local bonds but also elevates the
          region's presence on the national stage.

        <h3>What are fighting games?</h3>
        <p>
          Fighting games take many forms, but are usually one or two players
          against another team of one or two players, engaging in direct, often
          one-on-one, combat. These games typically feature a diverse roster of
          characters, each with unique abilities, special moves, and playstyles,
          challenging players to master their chosen fighter. Fighting games
          span many different types, from those focusing on executing difficult,
          precise combos to those based on outsmarting your opponent through
          strategic positioning and mind games, and everything in between,
          offering a rich variety of experiences for players to explore.
        </p>
        <h3>What is a fighting game community?</h3>
        <p>
          A fighting game community can be summed up as "A group of people who
          get together to play fighting games!" But it has far more depth than
          that. At its core, an FGC is a vibrant ecosystem encompassing both
          competitive and casual players. It's a place where individuals can
          push their skills in intense tournaments, learn from seasoned
          veterans, and celebrate the thrill of victory or the lessons of
          defeat. Simultaneously, it fosters a welcoming environment for casual
          players to enjoy friendly matches, discover new games, and simply
          share their passion. Beyond the gameplay, these communities are built
          on genuine friendship and camaraderie, offering a strong sense of
          belonging, mutual support, and shared enthusiasm for the genre that
          extends well beyond the virtual arena.

          As can be guessed, the NC FGC takes place in North Carolina! These
          events tend to be centered around local universities for younger
          participants, events at bars for 21+ events, and events at local
          arcades as well, providing varied environments that cater to different
          age groups and preferences. There are also larger events in state that
          occur in places such as the North Carolina Convention Center, allowing
          the community to host everything from intimate local gatherings to
          significant, multi-game tournaments that draw players from across the
          region and beyond, truly showcasing the breadth and depth of the NC

          Events also occur outside of North Carolina, in the form of a regional
          trip to areas such as Las Vegas, Nevada for EVO, and Frosty Faustings
          in Lombard, Illinois! These excursions highlight the NC FGC's strong
          ties to the broader national and international scene, offering members
          invaluable opportunities to compete against top talent, experience the
          excitement of major tournaments, and forge connections with players
          from across the globe, bringing back new skills and experiences to
          enrich the local community.

          There are quite a few rulesets used to govern these tournaments within
          the FGC, but there are the two most commonly used formats:
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Double Elimination</h3>
        <p>
          A double-elimination bracket is a tournament format where a
          participant must lose two matches to be eliminated from the
          competition. Players start in a "Winners Bracket," and if they lose a
          match there, they drop down into a "Losers Bracket." In the Losers
          Bracket, another loss means complete elimination. This structure
          provides a second chance for competitors, ensuring that a single bad
          match doesn't immediately end their tournament run, and often leads to
          exciting grand finals where the Winners Bracket finalist might need to
          be beaten twice by the Losers Bracket finalist.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Round Robin</h3>
        <p>
          A round-robin bracket is a tournament format where every participant
          plays every other participant a set number of times, typically once.
          Instead of advancing through a bracket based on wins and losses,
          participants accumulate points or simply track their win/loss record
          against all opponents. The winner is determined by who has the best
          overall record at the end of all matches. This format is often used in
          smaller tournaments or league play where it's important to establish a
          clear ranking among all competitors, as it thoroughly tests each
          participant against the entire field.

          Finding a sense of community is what everyone wants, and when that
          sense of community is representative of a wider competitive passion,
          it creates a strong bond and an environment that keeps people coming
          back. Seeing yourself improve while making friends and sharing
          strategies, celebrating both individual victories and collective
          achievements, fosters a unique camaraderie. This environment provides
          not just a place to hone skills, but also a supportive network for
          learning, mentorship, and mutual encouragement, where players can grow
          both as competitors and as individuals, forging lasting connections
          through shared challenges and triumphs that extend well beyond the
          game itself.

          "The NC FGC is a place where you'll find some of the most dedicated
          competitors pushing each other to new heights, but the moment the
          match is over, it's all high-fives and shared laughs. We take our
          games seriously, but we never forget that we're all here to have a
          great time and build something special together." -
