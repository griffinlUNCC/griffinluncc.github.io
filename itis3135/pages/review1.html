        <h3>Overall Review</h3>
        <p>
          The first issue I notice is that all links redirect to new pages. This
          should only be done for pages that lead to external sites, such as
          going from your ITIS-3135 to your Design Studio page, not your
          ITIS-3135 to the introduction page. There is also the issue of going
          from a "subpage," such as introduction, to another subpage. This is
          fixed by creating a different heading/footer template. This is seen in
          my site, as I ran into a similar issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for your other sites, they again have strong design fundamentals
          that use a good color scheme and CRAP principles properly. However,
          there are some small issues. Mighty Chicken should not have a course
          link, and I cannot find the hobby site.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think the sites are overall very well designed, and follow CRAP
          principles for the most part, with small misses listed above that
          don't apply to the design, just small development issues. The code and
          file organization is very well done and meets all standards. All
          expected sites and elements are present!
