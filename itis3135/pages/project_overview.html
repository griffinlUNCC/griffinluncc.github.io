          Displays a basic view of three pages. Leftmost is a single image and
          its magnified component. Middle is the homepage, and the right is the
          textbased pages. The animation and artwork page will look like the
          leftmost, and the rest will likely look like the rightmost, with the
          exception of the homepage, which is found in the center.

      <h3>Pages</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Home Page</b>
          <br />
          <p>
            The purpose of the home page is to inform users about the client,
            and provide a landing page that gives a sense of the purpose of the
            site and what users will get from every page. The audience of the
            site will be professors and prospective employers, but it will also
            have appeal and information for those such as other students looking
            for collaborative work. Users will not enter data, but will have
            hyperlinks to navigate to various pages. There will be no actions
            outside of page navigation.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Contact Page</b>
          <br />
          <p>
            The purpose of the contact page is to inform users about how to best
            contact my client, and provide a simple means of contacting my
            client by email via a form. This will primarily be used by
            recruiters and fellow students wishing to communicate. Users will
            enter data that will need validation. It will contain buttons and
            hyperlinks. Users will "submit" and send data to the server allowing
            for an email to be sent, as well as enter data and navigate between
            pages.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Resume Page</b>
          <br />
          <p>
            The purpose of the resume page is to inform users about the skillset
            of my client, and provide a summary of my clients current expertise
            and familiarity with industry tools and concepts. This will
            primarily be used by recruiters and professors. It will contain
            hyperlinks. Users can navigate between pages.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Art Portfolio Page</b>
          <br />
          <p>
            The purpose of the art portfolio page is to inform users about the
            skillset of my client specifically regarding artworks by providing
            annotated visual examples. This will primarily be used by recruiters
            and professors. It will contain hyperlinks. Users can navigate
            between pages. It will also provide interactivity via clicking on
            animations, as well as basic media controls.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Animation Portfolio Page</b>
          <br />
          <p>
            The purpose of the art portfolio page is to inform users about the
            skillset of my client specifically regarding artworks by providing
            annotated visual examples. This will primarily be used by recruiters
            and professors. It will contain hyperlinks. Users can navigate
            between pages. It will also provide interactivity via clicking on
            artworks.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Elements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Navbar</b>
          <br />
          <p>
            The navbar will provide consistent direction to all pages within the
            site, and be consistently themed.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Header</b>
          <br />
          <p>
            The header will contain the navbar, and provide both consistent
            theming via a logo and colorscheme that responds to interactivity,
            but also provide consistent direction between all pages within the
            site.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Footer</b>
          <br />
          <p>
            The footer will contain copyright info about my work on the site and
            a link to my personal design portfolio. The artworks themselves will
            have their relevant copyright dates cited.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Interactivity</b>
          <br />
          <p>
            The interactive elements in the site are listed below in the Dynamic
            Functionality portion.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Dynamic Functionality</h3>
      <p>
        As the page serves to be a portfolio piece primarily for the viewing of
        prospective employers and professors, the interactive functionality will
        be limited. Interactivity is planned for the gallery pages, as those
        viewing the art gallery will need to be able to view and switch between
        large quanities of art with ease. For the animation gallery, animations
        need to be able to be interacted with in some form, to allow for greater
        analysis of my client's abilities. I do wish to have a form for
        contacting them, which should be possible without exposing significant
        personal information. An example of an interactive art gallery would be
        found in the
        <a href="https://www.nga.gov/artworks">National Art Gallery</a>'s site,
        where I plan to have information visible about the work when the image
        is expanded. This will be possible with a basic database. For the
        animations, I plan for a concept similar to the above NGA site, but the
        animations themselves use an embedded player from an existing library to
        allow basic interactivity. For the form, which comes standard on many
        websites, the NGA again provides an example at the
        <a href="https://www.nga.gov/support/contact-us">NGA Support Site</a>.
