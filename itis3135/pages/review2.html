          <h3>Overall Review</h3>
          <p>
            All boxes are checked for the most part, with the sole exception
            being the use of times new roman on the ITIS-3135 page.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for the design itself, the use of colors is good and each page is
            both distinct and unique. On the ITSC-3135 page there is a small
            issue with the titlebar, where it overlaps with itself, but
            otherwise all pages are designed well, passing all validation tests
            and using CRAP fairly well. My only other suggestion would be a
            clearer visual separation between the two titlebars, as especially
            at smaller page resolutions that leads to wrapping and overlap.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the "Learn Python" site, there is some issue with whitespace
            where content is all left-aligned, and capped to a certain width,
            which works at smaller sizes, but at larger viewport widths leads to
            an unbalanced webpage. It is otherwise informative, with all pages
            that are well designed, containing content that is spaced well and
            properly split between pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            The issues above are not at all present on the hobby site, which is
            incredibly well designed, using a strong color palette, good
            hierarchy for content importance, and balances content well based on
            readability.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think the sites are overall very well designed, and follow CRAP
            principles for the most part, with small misses listed above. The
            code and file organization is very well done and meets all
            standards. All expected sites and elements are present!
