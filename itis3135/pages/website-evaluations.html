          <h3>The Odin Project</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
          The Odin Project is a croudsourced full-stack web development course,
          and fittingly has a well-designed webpage that serves as a strong
          example. It's website is aimed to encourage users to try their hand at
          web development, informing them of both the courses offerings and the
          success the course has led to.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <span>Contrast</span><br />
              The Odin Project's site serves as a good example for contast. For
              the colors, both light and dark mode use similar color schemes but
              are easily readable. Links and interactive elements are clearly
              distinguished from other text without interacting. Even text that
              is colored differently to emphasize itself has a similar contrast
              value to the rest of the text while remaining distinct from the
              rest of the site.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <span>Repetition</span><br />
              As for repetition, the Odin Project is again a great example.
              Elements of their webpage follow a few key patterns, and can
              easily be grouped with one another. Cards displaying course info
              always follow the same layout, paragraphs and website descriptions
              also are consistent and each page follows a very similar design
              layout. Fonts and design elements (buttons, cards, colors,
              stylings for shapes) are all also consistent and similar with one
              another in a meaningful way.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <span>Alignment</span><br />
              The Odin Project also implements alignment well. The pages have
              consistent spacing and elements are aligned with each other in
              such a way that your eye is able to move naturally between them.
              Text within elements is aligned the same way across all pages, and
              same with the placement of similar elements, or elements in
              position to one another.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <span>Proximity</span><br />
              The Odin Project also excels at proximity - related elements are
              grouped, and unrelated portions are split across different
              sections or pages without removing necessary information or
              dividing the design up significantly. White space is implemented
              well to both group and divide segments, and these segments flow
              naturally into one another.

          <h3>Suzanne Collin's Books</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
          Suzanne Collins is a well-known author most famous for the Hunger
          Games, so an online presence isn't necessarily crucial, and her
          website reflects that. Her website was made with the primary goal of
          informing readers aboout herself and her upcoming books, and directing
          readers to those books. While it accomplishes that goal well, it
          implements the vast majority of CRAP principles incorrectly, failing
          to be accessible or readable.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <span>Contrast</span><br />
              Startin with contrast, significant issues are already present. The
              color of headers, links, and emphasized text is a yellow-orange on
              a yellow or white background - leading to poor contrast and
              difficult to read text. The text itself also struggles with
              contrast - headings are often the same size as their subheadings,
              and are the same color and nearly the same size as the article
              text, making the information on the website difficult to parse.
              Interactive elements also have no distinguishing traits from the
              non-interactive elements - both are times new roman with a
              yellow-orange font color. Finally, quotes and paragraphs are
              written the same, leaving it difficult to parse which is which at
              a glance.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <span>Repetition</span><br />
              Suzanne Collin's site is a mixed example. While some elements are
              consistently placed and have a fixed layout, such as the sidebar
              containing links to interviews and quotes, other elements have
              variable spacing and content, even within the same page, leading
              to a difficult to parse layout. She does have a consistent color
              scheme and font choice, which generally (but not always) are
              applied to the same elements so readers can parse what has what
              purpose on the site at a glance.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <span>Alignment</span><br />
              Due to the simplicity of Collin's website, Alignment is
              implemented fairly well. Each page has the same structure - a left
              sidebar holding some relevant information, a main column holding
              the majority of the page's information, and a right sidebar
              containing a collection of links. Alignment is a bit inconsistent
              in some parts - depending on your viewport, elements such as the
              nav will be centered or uncentered. Separate content blocks are
              also poorly aligned - with inconsistent spacing between each
              paragraph and image.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <span>Proximity</span><br />
              As for proximity, Collin's page serves as a consistent example of
              what not to do - offering both clutter and too much whitespace
              consistently. Pages often have far too much whitespace on both
              sides when in desktop view, and content doesn't tend to span the
              whole height of the page. Paragraphs and images are often spaced
              apart varyingly, regardless of if they are supposed to be grouped
              together or not. As such, unrelated items are often close to one
              another, and items regarding the same topic are often split apart.
